4.Run the following command to install the dependencies:
Copy code
npm install

5.Once the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:
Copy code
npm start

6.This will compile the code and launch the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it by visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
